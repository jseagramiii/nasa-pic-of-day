        This is a simple react app using nasa's open api's (they have many)
        axios and reach router.
      </h4>
      <h5>
        The implementation of reach router in this is an experiment between
        React router and reach router. comparing the two, I really like reach
        router due to it's simplicity and only needing to import and use two
        components.
